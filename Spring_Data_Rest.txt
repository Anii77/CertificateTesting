Spring Data REST is a powerful extension of the 
Spring Data project that lets you automatically expose your Spring Data repositories as 
RESTful web services—without writing any controller code. 
It’s perfect for quickly building CRUD APIs over your domain models .



What It Does
Automatically creates REST endpoints for your JPA entities

Supports CRUD operations, pagination, sorting, and search

Follows HATEOAS principles (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)

Uses HAL format for linking resources.


How It Works

1)
You define your JPA entity:

@Entity
public class Student {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
}

2)You create a Spring Data repository:
@RepositoryRestResource(path = "students")
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Long> {
    List<Student> findByName(@Param("name") String name);
}


3)
Spring Data REST exposes endpoints like:

GET /students

POST /students

GET /students/{id}

DELETE /students/{id}

GET /students/search/findByName?name=John
