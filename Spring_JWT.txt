What algorithm is commonly used to sign a JWT?
HMAC-SHA256

What type of information is typically stored in the payload of a JWT?
Claims like user roles or expiration times.

Which header parameter specifies the algorithm used to sign a JWT?
alg

What does the 'exp' claim in a JWT indicate?
The expiration time of the JWT

How can a JWT be verified on the server side?
By comparing the signature using secret key

Which claim is used to specify the issuer of a JWT?
iss

What is a key advantage of using JWT for authentication?
it is lightweight and stateless


What is the primary purpose of OAuth?
Delegating access without sharing credentials.

What is the typical expiration time of a JWT access token?
Configurable by the server

What is the purpose of the "refresh token" in OAuth?
To extend the expiration time of an access token.

In OAuth, who issues the access_token?
Application Server

Which HTTP method is commonly used to exchange an authorization code for an access token in OAuth?
POST

What is the purpose of the scope parameter in OAuth?
To define the level of access requested.

What does a JSON Web Token (JWT) consist of?
Header,Payload and Signature.

Which part of a JWT is used to verify that the token has not been tampered with?
Signature


Spring JWT (JSON Web Token) is a powerful way to implement stateless 
authentication in Spring Boot applications—especially for REST APIs. 
It allows you to securely transmit user identity and claims between client and server without relying on sessions.

What Is JWT?
A compact, URL-safe token used to represent claims between two parties.

Consists of three parts:Header.Payload.Signature


Spring JWT Authentication Flow
User logs in with credentials.

Server authenticates and generates a JWT.

JWT is sent to the client (usually in response body or header).

Client stores it (e.g., in localStorage).

For future requests, client sends JWT in Authorization: Bearer <token> header.

Server validates the token and grants access.
