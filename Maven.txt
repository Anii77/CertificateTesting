Maven is a Project Management Tools which is used to manage the dependencies.

It streamlines the process of building, testing, and deploying software by automating tasks like
dependency management, compiling code, and creating project documentation.



Maven uses XML for project configuration and follows a strict lifecycle, 
making it suitable for smaller projects or those prioritizing stability.


Gradle offers more flexibility through its Groovy-based build scripts, 
enabling customization and supporting multiple languages, making it a good fit for larger
and more complex projects. 



groupId
What it is: Represents the unique domain or organization that owns the project.

Think of it like: A namespace (similar to Java packages).

Convention: Uses reverse domain notation.
<groupId>com.aniket.framework</groupId>


üìò artifactId
What it is: The actual name of the project or module you're building.

This becomes the JAR/war name: artifactId-version.jar

Should be unique within a groupId.
<artifactId>test-utils</artifactId>



üî¢ version
What it is: The specific version of your build.

Helps manage versions during development and deployment.

Often follows MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, or includes -SNAPSHOT for dev versions.

<version>1.0.0</version>


What is the Effective POM?
> The Effective POM is the merged, fully-resolved version of your pom.xml, including:

Your project‚Äôs own pom.xml

Inherited settings from parent POMs (like spring-boot-starter-parent)

Configuration from profiles

Default values from Super POM



üèóÔ∏è What is a Maven Archetype?
A Maven archetype is a template for generating new projects. Think of it as a starter kit that gives you:

Predefined folder structure (src/main/java, resources, test)

Sample pom.xml

Sample Java classes, config files, test stubs


groupId: project namespace

artifactId: project folder name + final JAR name

archetypeArtifactId: tells Maven which template to use (quickstart = Java project with tests)


Popular Built-in Archetypes
Archetype	                     Purpose
maven-archetype-quickstart	   Simple Java application template
maven-archetype-webapp	         Basic web application structure
maven-archetype-j2ee-simple	   Java EE sample project
maven-archetype-site	         Generates Maven site structure
