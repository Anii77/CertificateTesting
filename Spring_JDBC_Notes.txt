Row Mapper
In Spring, a RowMapper is a powerful interface used with JdbcTemplate 
to map rows of a ResultSet to Java objects—perfect for clean, 
object-oriented database access without boilerplate code.

It’s a callback interface with a single method:
T mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException;

Spring calls this method for each row in the result set.

You return a fully populated object for each row—Spring collects them into a list.





public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private double salary;
    // Getters, setters, constructors
}


public class EmployeeRowMapper implements RowMapper<Employee> {
    @Override
    public Employee mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
        return new Employee(
            rs.getInt("id"),
            rs.getString("name"),
            rs.getDouble("salary")
        );
    }
}

List<Employee> employees = jdbcTemplate.query(
    "SELECT * FROM employee",
    new EmployeeRowMapper()
);

H2 is a lightweight, fast, in-memory SQL database written in Java—perfect for development, 
testing, and small-scale applications. 
It’s especially popular in Spring Boot projects because of how seamlessly it integrates.

To use H2 in a Spring Boot app:
Add dependencies in pom.xml:
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
  <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
spring.h2.console.enabled=true

What Is JdbcTemplate?
It’s a core class in Spring JDBC that:

Manages connections and exceptions for you

Executes SQL queries, updates, and stored procedures

Works seamlessly with RowMapper.

Why Use It?
Reduces boilerplate: No need to manually manage Connection, Statement, or ResultSet
